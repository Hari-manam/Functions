Story: A Bankâ€™s Quest to Improve Loan Approvals
A leading bank wants to refine its loan approval process by analyzing customer behavior. To achieve this, the bank collects data on customersâ€™ credit scores, transaction history, and loan approvals. The goal is to make more data-driven decisions using statistical techniques such as association, dependence, correlation, covariance, Simpsonâ€™s Paradox, clustering, and probability mass functions (PMF).

1. Understanding Association and Dependence
The bank wants to explore whether a customerâ€™s credit score is associated with loan approval.

Association means a relationship exists between credit score and loan approval, but it does not imply a cause-and-effect relationship.
Dependence means that loan approval is influenced by credit scores and possibly other hidden factors like income, existing loans, and spending habits.
The correlation matrix helps the bank understand how strongly credit score and loan approval are related.
Insight: Customers with higher credit scores tend to have better chances of loan approval, but other factors could be at play.

2. Causation vs. Correlation
Correlation means that as one variable changes, another changes in a predictable way (e.g., as credit scores increase, loan approvals also tend to increase).
However, correlation does not imply causationâ€”just because a high credit score is linked with higher loan approvals does not mean it directly causes approval.
Example: A high credit score correlates with a high approval rate, but income stability, employment status, and debt-to-income ratio are also deciding factors.

3. Covariance â€“ Do High Credit Score Customers Spend More?
The bank examines whether customers with higher credit scores tend to make more transactions.

Covariance measures how two variables change together.
A positive covariance suggests that as a customerâ€™s credit score increases, their monthly transactions also increase.
Insight: Customers with high credit scores might have more financial stability, leading to more spending and transactions.

4. Simpsonâ€™s Paradox â€“ Unveiling Hidden Biases
The bank finds that loan approval rates differ when segmented by fraudulent activity.

At first glance, customers with higher credit scores appear to have higher approval rates.
But when the data is grouped based on fraudulent activity, an opposite trend emergesâ€”customers flagged for fraud have lower approval rates, even if their credit scores are high.
Lesson: Averages across entire datasets can be misleading when underlying subgroups are not considered.

5. Clustering â€“ Segmenting Customers for Better Loan Decisions
Using K-Means Clustering, the bank classifies customers into groups based on their credit score and transaction frequency.

Low-risk customers: High credit scores and frequent transactions â†’ Likely to be approved.
Medium-risk customers: Moderate credit scores with average transactions.
High-risk customers: Low credit scores and few transactions â†’ Likely to be denied or require further evaluation.
Impact: The bank can now personalize loan offers and minimize risks by understanding customer segments.

6. Probability Mass Function (PMF) â€“ Predicting Loan Approval Chances
To estimate the likelihood of a random customer getting a loan approved, the bank calculates the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of loan approvals (1) and denials (0).

PMF gives a probability distribution of discrete outcomes.
The bank finds that Loan Approval (1) has a 60% probability, while Loan Denial (0) has a 40% probability.
Actionable Insight: Based on historical data, the bank can estimate the likelihood of new applicants being approved or denied.

Final Takeaways
By combining statistical analysis, machine learning (clustering), and probability theory, the bank has:
âœ… Identified relationships between credit scores and loan approvals.
âœ… Uncovered hidden patterns (Simpsonâ€™s Paradox).
âœ… Segmented customers to improve loan decision-making.
âœ… Estimated loan approval probabilities using PMF.

This analysis empowers the bank to reduce financial risks, approve loans more effectively, and enhance customer satisfaction. ðŸš€
