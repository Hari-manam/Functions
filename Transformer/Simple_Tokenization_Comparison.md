Tokenization: GPT vs BERT vs T5 (Simple Explanation for Beginners)



What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units (called tokens) that a language model can understand. Different models break down text in different ways depending on how they are trained.



How Text is Split

| Model | How It Splits Text |
| **GPT (ChatGPT)** | Breaks text into very small parts (even spaces and punctuation). Example: `"ChatGPT is great!"` ‚Üí `["Chat", "G", "PT", " is", " great", "!"]` |
| **BERT** | Splits text into subwords with `##` for suffixes. Example: `"ChatGPT"` ‚Üí `["Chat", "##G", "##PT"]` |
| **T5** | Uses smart rules to split full sentences into best-guess chunks. Example: `"ChatGPT is great!"` ‚Üí `["‚ñÅChatGPT", "‚ñÅis", "‚ñÅgreat", "!"]` |



How They Handle Unknown or Rare Words

| Model | Strategy |
| **GPT** | Breaks them into smaller byte-based known chunks. |
| **BERT** | Uses base word + suffix format like `play` + `##ing`. |
| **T5** | Splits based on probability of best match. |



Example: ‚ÄúChatGPT is great!‚Äù

| Model | Tokens |
| **GPT** | Chat, G, PT, is, great, ! ‚Üí 6 tokens |
| **BERT** | Chat, ##G, ##PT, is, great, ! ‚Üí 6 tokens |
| **T5** | ChatGPT, is, great, ! ‚Üí 4 tokens |



Token Count Meaning

| Model | What Token Length Means |
| **GPT** | Number of small chunks after splitting every space/symbol |
| **BERT** | Number of base + suffix word parts |
| **T5** | Number of smart predicted chunks |

Models That Use These Tokenizers

| Model Type | Example Models |
| **GPT** | GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT |
| **BERT** | BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, GPT-2 |
| **T5** | T5, mT5, ByT5, FLAN-T5 |


Summary (In Simple Words)

- **GPT**: Breaks everything ‚Äî words, spaces, punctuation ‚Äî into tiny tokens.
- **BERT**: Adds `##` to suffixes for rare words.
- **T5**: Breaks the sentence into the smartest possible pieces.

All do this to make it easier for AI to understand and generate language ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs new, rare, or misspelled.

# üî§ Tokenization in Transformers ‚Äì Simple Guide

Transformers work with numbers, not raw text. **Tokenization** is the process of converting text into **tokens** that can be fed into a model.

---

What is a Token?

A **token** is a small chunk of text. It can be:
- A word
- A subword
- A character
- A byte


How Tokenization Works

1. Text: `"Transformers are powerful."`
2. Tokenized: `["Transform", "ers", " are", " powerful", "."]`
3. Token IDs: `[1012, 3421, 2011, 4021, 102]`

These token IDs are what the model actually sees.

Tokenizer Types and Models

| Model / Platform        | Tokenizer Type            | Tool / Library         | Description                                                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hugging Face**        | BPE, WordPiece, Unigram   | `transformers`, `tokenizers` | Supports multiple tokenizers for flexibility                     |
| **ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT)**| Byte-level BPE            | `tiktoken`             | Breaks input into bytes ‚Üí subwords; good with emojis, UTF-8      |
| **Gemini (Google)**     | SentencePiece + Unigram   | Internal tools         | Based on PaLM models; likely uses Unigram + custom tweaks        |
| **T5 (Google)**         | SentencePiece + Unigram   | `sentencepiece`        | Learns best subwords using a probabilistic language model        |



Common Tokenizer Types Explained

| Tokenizer Type     | How It Works                                                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)** | Merges frequent character pairs into subwords                             |
| **WordPiece**      | Similar to BPE, but uses a greedy strategy (used in BERT)              |
| **Unigram LM**     | Picks best subword split using probability model                       |
| **SentencePiece**  | Trains on raw text directly (no whitespace needed), uses BPE or Unigram|
| **Byte-level BPE** | Converts text into UTF-8 bytes ‚Üí subwords (GPT-2, GPT-4)               |

Example: Word = `"unbelievable"`

| Tokenizer Type     | Output Tokens                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| **BPE**            | `["un", "believ", "able"]`         |
| **WordPiece**      | `["un", "##believable"]`           |
| **Unigram LM**     | `["unbelievable"]` or `["un", "believ", "able"]` |
| **Byte-level BPE** | `["u", "n", "b", "el", "ie", "v", "able"]` (byte subwords) |

Why It Matters

- **Smaller vocabulary** ‚Üí less memory
- **Handles rare words** ‚Üí better generalization
- **Consistent across languages** ‚Üí works with any UTF-8 text
