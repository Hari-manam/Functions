Tokenization: GPT vs BERT vs T5 (Simple Explanation for Beginners)



What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units (called tokens) that a language model can understand. Different models break down text in different ways depending on how they are trained.



How Text is Split

| Model | How It Splits Text |
| **GPT (ChatGPT)** | Breaks text into very small parts (even spaces and punctuation). Example: `"ChatGPT is great!"` → `["Chat", "G", "PT", " is", " great", "!"]` |
| **BERT** | Splits text into subwords with `##` for suffixes. Example: `"ChatGPT"` → `["Chat", "##G", "##PT"]` |
| **T5** | Uses smart rules to split full sentences into best-guess chunks. Example: `"ChatGPT is great!"` → `["▁ChatGPT", "▁is", "▁great", "!"]` |



How They Handle Unknown or Rare Words

| Model | Strategy |
| **GPT** | Breaks them into smaller byte-based known chunks. |
| **BERT** | Uses base word + suffix format like `play` + `##ing`. |
| **T5** | Splits based on probability of best match. |



Example: “ChatGPT is great!”

| Model | Tokens |
| **GPT** | Chat, G, PT, is, great, ! → 6 tokens |
| **BERT** | Chat, ##G, ##PT, is, great, ! → 6 tokens |
| **T5** | ChatGPT, is, great, ! → 4 tokens |



Token Count Meaning

| Model | What Token Length Means |
| **GPT** | Number of small chunks after splitting every space/symbol |
| **BERT** | Number of base + suffix word parts |
| **T5** | Number of smart predicted chunks |

Models That Use These Tokenizers

| Model Type | Example Models |
| **GPT** | GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT |
| **BERT** | BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, GPT-2 |
| **T5** | T5, mT5, ByT5, FLAN-T5 |


Summary (In Simple Words)

- **GPT**: Breaks everything — words, spaces, punctuation — into tiny tokens.
- **BERT**: Adds `##` to suffixes for rare words.
- **T5**: Breaks the sentence into the smartest possible pieces.

All do this to make it easier for AI to understand and generate language — even if it’s new, rare, or misspelled.
