# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Techniques

##  Why Use RAG Instead of Just LLMs?

| Aspect           | Just LLM |                     RAG |

| Factual Accuracy | ❌ Can hallucinate | ✅ Anchored to real data |
| Token Limit      | ❌ Prone to cutoff | ✅ Retrieves only what’s needed |
| Domain Specificity | ❌ Needs retraining | ✅ Plug in new data without retraining |
| Fresh Knowledge  | ❌ Frozen at training | ✅ Pulls up-to-date content |
| Cost & Size      | ❌ Needs larger LLMs | ✅ Small LLM + retrieval = cheaper |

##  1. Standard RAG

- **What**: Retrieve relevant documents → combine with prompt → feed into LLM
- **Why**: Add external factual grounding to LLM output
- **Use Case**: FAQs, chatbots, document Q&A
- **Limitation**: Context overflow, shallow fusion of docs



##  2. Fusion RAG (Fusion-in-Decoder)

- **What**: Feed each retrieved document **separately** into the decoder, not as one merged chunk
- **Why**: Allows the model to **attend to each document individually**
- **Use Case**: Research assistants, legal/medical queries
- **Strength**: Better accuracy, no dilution of context
- **Limitation**: More compute cost (parallel processing)



##  3. Speculative RAG

- **What**: Use a small LLM to **guess** the answer, then large LLM to **verify or improve**
- **Why**: **Speed up** generation without loss in quality
- **Use Case**: Real-time customer support, live search
- **Strength**: Fast + efficient
- **Limitation**: Requires orchestration of 2 models



##  4. Corrective RAG (Self-Refinement)

- **What**: After generating an answer, a second LLM or rule checks and **corrects** it
- **Why**: Fix hallucinations or incomplete responses
- **Use Case**: Compliance, legal advisors, auditing tools
- **Strength**: Higher trust and explainability
- **Limitation**: Adds latency and complexity

##  5. Agentic RAG

- **What**: Multiple agents handle separate tasks: retrieval, summarization, critique, decision
- **Why**: Modular, reusable agent blocks = more intelligent behavior
- **Use Case**: AI tutors, financial advisors, multi-step workflows
- **Strength**: Task-specific reasoning and chain of thought
- **Limitation**: Complex to build and coordinate

##  Summary Comparison

| RAG Type       | What It Solves              | Strengths                            | When to Use                            |
|----------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Standard RAG   | Adds external knowledge       | Simple, widely supported              | General Q&A, support bots               |
| Fusion RAG     | Poor doc merging              | High accuracy, multi-doc attention    | Academic, legal, healthcare tasks       |
| Speculative RAG| Slow inference                | Fast + cost-efficient                 | Real-time apps, user-facing assistants  |
| Corrective RAG | Hallucinations, reliability   | Self-checking answers                 | Regulated industries, critical tasks    |
| Agentic RAG    | Task delegation, reasoning    | Modular, flexible pipelines           | Multi-function AI apps, tutoring agents |

##  Final Note

> RAG isn’t just about fetching documents. It’s about making **LLMs trustworthy, efficient, and adaptable** using real-world knowledge and smart design patterns.
