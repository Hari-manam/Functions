1. What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep') to model and understand complex patterns in data. It's especially effective for unstructured data like images, text, and audio.
2. Where Deep Learning is Used
- Image Recognition (e.g., facial recognition, medical scans)
- Natural Language Processing (e.g., chatbots, language translation)
- Speech Recognition (e.g., voice assistants)
- Autonomous Vehicles (e.g., object detection)
- Financial predictions, fraud detection
3. Deep Learning Layers
Deep learning networks typically include:
- Input Layer: Accepts input data
- Hidden Layers: 2 or more layers that transform data through learned weights
- Output Layer: Produces final prediction
Examples:
- Simple MLP: 3-5 layers
- CNNs (e.g., AlexNet): 8+ layers
- Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT-3): 12 to 96+ layers

TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google for building and training machine learning models using data flow graphs.
PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook (Meta) that provides a dynamic and flexible approach to building neural networks.

4. PyTorch vs TensorFlow
Feature	PyTorch	TensorFlow	Advantages	Disadvantages
Ease of Use	More Pythonic and intuitive	Steeper learning curve	Beginner-friendly for researchers	Less ecosystem integration
Popularity	Preferred in academia	Preferred in industry	Great for experimentation	May lack certain deployment features
Debugging	Eager execution (easy to debug)	Graph-based (TF 1.x was hard, 2.x improved)	Immediate feedback	Graph mode can be complex
Deployment	Limited built-in tools	Strong production deployment (TF Serving, Lite)	TF supports mobile, edge, cloud	PyTorch deployment needs TorchScript/ONNX
Model Building	Dynamic computation graphs	Static (with eager mode in TF 2.x)	Flexible for complex models	Less flexible than PyTorch
Community Support	Strong in research	Strong in enterprise	Active open source development	Some learning curve
Visualization	Supports TensorBoard via adapter	Built-in TensorBoard support	Same tools available	PyTorch needs plugins
